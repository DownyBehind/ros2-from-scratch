# ROS 2 Study from Scratch (Foxy + Ubuntu 20.04)

This repository documents my journey of learning **ROS 2 Foxy** from the ground up on **Ubuntu 20.04**.

## ✨ Why I'm Studying ROS 2

As robotics and autonomous driving systems evolve, understanding their software architecture is essential.
I'm studying **ROS 2 (Foxy)** to:

- Build a strong foundation in robot software development
- Understand key ROS 2 concepts like nodes, topics, services, actions, and launch files
- Prepare for working with **Autoware**, an open-source autonomous driving software stack built on ROS 2

## 🚀 Goal

My long-term goal is to gain the skills needed to work on autonomous driving systems by:

- Mastering ROS 2 Foxy concepts and tooling
- Understanding how ROS 2 enables modular, distributed, and real-time behavior in robotic systems
- Transitioning into **Autoware.AI** and **Autoware.Auto** development environments

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- 📁 `tutorials/`: Code examples based on ROS 2 official tutorials
- 🧪 `experiments/`: Custom test nodes and communication patterns
- 📝 `notes/`: Study notes, architecture diagrams, and command references
- 🔧 `launch/`: Launch files and package setups
- 📡 `communication/`: Publisher/Subscriber, Service/Client, Action examples

## 🛠 Development Environment

- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- **ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy**
- Programming Languages: **Python 3**, **C++ (rclcpp)**
- Tools: `colcon`, `rviz2`, `ros2bag`, `ros2 topic`, `ros2 service`, `ros2 action`
